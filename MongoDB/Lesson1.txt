LESSON 1: MongoDB Basics â€“ Documents, Collections, BSON

Topics:

    What exactly is MongoDB storing?
    Difference between Document, Collection, and Database
    JSON vs BSON
    Quick mental model of NoSQL vs SQL


1. MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents, offering flexibility compared to traditional relational databases that use tables.

    Core Structure:
        SQL Term: Table, Row, Database
        MongoDB Equivalent: Collection, Document, Database

    Note: MongoDB doesn't force fixed schema (the next documents can have more or fewer fields)

2. JSON vs BSON: 
    MongoDB stores data in BSON - Binary JSON
    Why? 
    - Fast Parsing
    - Supports additional types like Date, ObjectId, etc.

    eg. 
        {
            "_id": ObjectId("654f8c92d3d4a9a5a1a9e12e"),
            "createdAt": ISODate("2024-05-03T09:00:00Z")
        }


MongoDB is perfect for: 
- Real-time apps
- E-commerce
- Content management
