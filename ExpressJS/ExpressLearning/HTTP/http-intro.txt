What is an HTTP?
HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, basically a language that allows computers to talk to each other across the internet.

We as humans, when we want to transfer our thoughts between each other, we have this
thing called language, or we could call it "Thought Transfer Protocol".
We make these sounds across the air and we allow each other to understand our own 
thoughts.

Similarly when computers want to talk to each other across the Internet, they need 
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

# When we make our HTTP request, there are five main words:
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

GET: 
    We use GET when we want to request a resource from the server. This could be a HTML 
    Website, it could be some piece of text, it could be a piece of data from the 
    database or the server.

    We are getting something when we make our HTTP request using the GET keyword.


POST:
    In POST request, we are sending a resource to the server. 
    This could be a piece of information like we have a form to sign up to our website.
    The email and password is going to be sent to our server when they click the sign-up button.
    And this is going to be done using a POST request.

PUT and PATCH are similar as both of them are update methods. However, they are bit different.

A PUT request is when we want to Replace a resource with whatever we are sending. Basically we want to update something by replacing it completely.

PATCH is little bit different and similar to English word, as in patch-up the resource,
only the required parts (to be updated).

DELETE:
    It just deletes resources, either from the server or from the database.
